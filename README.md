This is just simple demo of AJAX-navigation through the site links + control over back/next browser buttons. Uses jQuery.

Live demo: http://www.utilmind.com/demos/2019/ajax-navigation/

AK: This demo will not be updated. I have plan to create prototype object for AJAX-navigation (probably jQuery-based too), but this will be in another repository.
